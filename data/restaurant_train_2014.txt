But the staff was so horrible to us.
The food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not.
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat.
For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.
The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.
i've noticed megadeth, mr. scruff, st. germain, traditional vietnamese songs, black sabbath, jay-z, and daft punk all being played.
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.
It took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!
The design and atmosphere is just as good.
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.
I would definitely recommend Mary's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts.
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza.
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!
He can't help, they're bought up so fast.
Secondly, on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume.
i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience.
Obviously run by folks who know a pie.
We were very disappointed.
I really liked this place.
I will be going back very soon.
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.
I asked for seltzer with lime, no ice.
It was pretty inexpensive too.
Will not be back.
Don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience, with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods.
My suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other dishes.
This isn't a value joint.
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning.
The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth's is the Strip House.
We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.
You'll adore it.
Two words: Free wine.
The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.
Raga's is a romantic, cozy restaurant.
The fried rice is amazing here.
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.
At the end you're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup.
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.
The wine list is excellent.
so garantuan that you can't fit them in a toaster.
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before, and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had (except for my mom's of course).
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.
Whem asked, we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were.
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner.
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner.
Not what I wanted to hear.
Try the lasagnette appetizer.
I've been there a few times, and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people.
I liked the beer selection!
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.
Can't wait to go back.
I grew up eating Dosa and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds.
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.
If you are a carnivore, come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been.
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.
Not too crazy about their sake martini.
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.
whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT.
One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests.
This place is a great bargain.
We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results.
Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out.
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied.
Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks, swirl them around, and eat.
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.
My husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry.
Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly, helpful, and willing to the extra mile for a customer.
The pizza was pretty good and huge.
Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I'm in NYC.
The cuisine from what I've gathered is authentic Taiwanese, though its very different from what I've been accustomed to in Taipei.
I heartily recommend.
Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones.
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was.
We ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat.
This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!
This place is so much fun.
I was glad I did.
I've never been treated so rudely.
I'll be back soon.
Le Pere Pinard has a $15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding.
Went inside and I started to get excited.
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal.
However, it is jus too good to not praise it.
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason.
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.
It's somewhere you can eat and be happy.
If you wrote a bad review, it's because you don't understand what Rao's is all about.
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!
but overall i give it a 10
Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC.
I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.
This was one of the BEST restaurants I've ever been to.
This restaurant used to be pretty decent.
An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.
If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare, you'll love Artisanal!
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.
Some baby pizzas get their wish.
Plenty of choices to make your own creation.
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone's living room.
I was there on sat.
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.
VT is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up.
The last time I went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen.
Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale Italian decor.
Not impressed with the food.
The entire dining experience was wonderful!
Service is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.
Order the panang duck, it's fantastic.
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.
Other than the crappy service from two individuals, it's great.
What more can you ask for?
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment.
You are treated just like royality.
There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).
Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.
I've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe.
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.
Looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is).
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.
I look forward to eating here again
I've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste.
A glass of Leaping Lizard, a glass of prosecco, and the mussels had everything happy.
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.
I know because I live nearby.
The pizza here is delicious.
My entire family was horrified.
On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out.
For great chinese food nearby, you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away.
But who says Murray's is anything about service.
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.
Hats off to the chef.
This should have been done in a back room - away from customers.
Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers.
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe.
Check it out
First off, the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong.
Don't go.
The food was bland oily.
But they do.
The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary.
Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place (PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES).
Suan has challenged this loyalty.
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.
And Kruno, the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across.
Ambiance and music funky, which I enjoy.
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date.
It's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars.
Went with mommy (the only person who could afford taking me here).
My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend.
Last time I went here, the waitress didn't come back after taking our order.
Try the tandoori salmon!
I am completely hooked on this place, it is ridiculous.
Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response.
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.
I love the atmorphere @ peep!
Enjoy!
We weren't!
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed.
(La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico).
It could have been handled better.
The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark.
The other night we had the $30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of.
Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!
Even after getting pushed out by the no-class Famous Ray's, Sal has risen again to carry on his father's uncle's legacies with a smile, true love for his community, and let's not forget the Outstanding Pizza!
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.
We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess, it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well.
I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion.
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy.
I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky.
So I've never actually been to M proper, but I've had it delivered a few times.
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money.
Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.
The food is great.
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and sides that don't look like leafy road kill.
Lunch came with pickels and slaw, no extra charge.
All conveniently delivered right to the door.
even the wine by the glass was good.
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant.
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.
I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world.
Okay service.
We were very pleasantly surprised.
The food was just awful, ATROCIOUS actually.
I will never visit this restaurant again.
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.
(or sister, in my case!).
I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants.
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant.
Don't go there!
Ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.
Good luck getting a table.
We picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect.
Don't look down your nose at me like that...
Planet Thai is great!
The service is awful.
Just don't do it.
Just ignore the trendy wannabes.
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!
Trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time.
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night.
I wish they had one near my office- I would go everyday.
Finally!
Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years.
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is.
I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated.
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes.
The pizza is good though.
You will not be disapointed at all.
Walk-ins are risky too.
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.
They didn't give us the dinner special until we asked for it.
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.
word of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.
Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.
Our food was great too!
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.
Get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings.
Please try the Filet Mignon, its just the most tender piece ever.
Everything we had was pretty good, but we have only been there once.
We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.
Something about them being busy with holiday party's.
The sake menu should not be overlooked!
I would highly recommend.
This place is great.
i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they're that good.
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.
Went there last night for 2 year anniversery, and wasn't all that impressed.
It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us.
We were seated promptly as we had reservations, however after that the service was slow.
At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC.
It's really also the service, is good and the waiters are friendly.
Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded.
The food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert.
We visit at least once a month.
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.
Also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.
I'll keep this short.
I felt as though I were eating in Paris.
However, it's not worth a special trip.
Nice value.
Gigino's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable.
And it was quick which is very important.
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.
All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere.
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).
But, nothing stands out about the cooking.
If that's a problem, go to McDonald's and destroy your insides.
I've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.
I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.
I work near-by, and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item.
Always busy but fast moving.
Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.
Sexy.
The food was really good, I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever.
I will have to say, this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite.
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.
Based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for Dim Sum again.
Even with John's and Joe's around the corner, this place will make a name for itself.
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.
When he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic.
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.
The dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of Chinese here).
despite the untasteful previous review...
Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.
Sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know Sal, is to know New York.
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.
Also they were $15 each!
The service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for.
My friends spoke so much about it for months, I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.
This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.
If you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!
You order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.
One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown.
We will go back every time we are in the City.
we love th pink pony.
So eat fast and order a lot.
Staff is very accomodating.
I have to agree with the previous reviewer.
--Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons
If you were there when it first opened, give this restaurant a second chance.
I went to Del Frisco's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation.
If you like Sakagura but you feel it's too much, you'd better try Yokocho.
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me.
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.
You can't go wrong with this place.
Very popular style Izakaya (Sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ).
Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.
We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip, and the food was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them.
Quick and friendly service.
Authentic bistro!
They are tasty, but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system.
Somewhat pricey but what the heck.
It's true, this place is not cheap.
Try the hot dogs too, they're snappy and delicious.
Delivery is fast too.
Being from the south, there aren't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz's Deli.
The noise level was unbearable, conversation impossible.
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls.
One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way.
It's convenient.
Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip.
Oh right, I should probably say something nice.
Odd for Ave B, not just odd, The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least.
When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.
Instead of wasting your time here: SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT FOOD.
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions.
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent.
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st, taj mahal is also very comparable, in food quality, to the much overpraised (and underdeserving) baluchi's.
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).
Try the cheesecake!
David, Daytona Beach, FL
Perhaps.
Go here.
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
Rosario's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence.
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the price paid, I expected it to have some type of flavor.
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich.
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals.
The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished.
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.
We generally like good restaurants and eat out often but Kai was way to expensive for what we got.
What a great place.
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.
Don't eat here unless you're starving for thai food and you work next door.
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.
I had the best ravioli ever.
While the menu isn't especially groundbreaking, everything I've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty.
Ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding.
The bill is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without drinks.
Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried.
The overall price tag was very very expensive, something I did expect.
By the time we were done, it was past 1:00am.
Read all the other review, they'll confirm it.
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.
The service was attentive.
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella, but every pie is ultra fresh.
Fish was overdone.
Great idea and base for restaurant, but work on the details, people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like.
When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.
I have been twice to this restaurant.
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection.
You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros.
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style.
Good food.
The wait staff is very friendly, if not overly efficient.
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.
The dim sum however was very good.
It's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night.
Service has always been friendly and efficient.
Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers.
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch.
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.
Prices are very good.
We could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us.
Fantastic place.
Plain and simple it's bad thai food.
Definitely not a restaurant to skip!
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.
Usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish.
While certain staples are excellent (the burger, some of the pastas), the food is not really the point.
The Dim Sum was so-so, but not spectacular.
The food was so-so.
The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints, and has a bar which deserves a mention.
What a ripoff!
Threw my fiance's surprise 30th birthday dinner here couldn't be happier.
You can do it here.
Food-awesome.
There was a small wait, but shorter than I expected.
May, the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you.
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.
I just read Mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.
The sides were ok and incredibly salty.
It hits the spot every time
For some reason, all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon.
Not a large place, but it's cute and cozy.
Don't be fooled by crowds of people.
and there's no way out.
The beverages were excellent, and the dessert was good.
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.
Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.
Please if your thinking about it go, and stay the wait you won't be disappointed.
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful!
If you'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent, Long Tan is a good place on the slope.
When going out for a nice dinner, I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food.
For all you lazy folks that don't want to come to Alphabet City, I say, good - stay out.
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.
A++   The service was good to excellent along with the attitude.
This is my fourth try over a two year period, and I'm done.
The food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass.
The music does get a little loud at times, but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife, and as I did, I got a whiff of corriander.
black white shakes came out good also.
It's simply the best meal in NYC.
Probably would not go again...
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner.
The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant, so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here.
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken.
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon.
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place (the first being Joya).
However, they've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot.
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread, but all the bagles are unbeliavably good.
I wouldn't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy, too.
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.
Also good for client lunch meetings, esp.
For $600 ( the most we have ever paid) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance.
The setting is casual and romantic.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.
Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants.
As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.
I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had.
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else.
The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good.
Emilio, the owner, is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go.
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner.
Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!
A cheap eat for NYC, but not for dosa.
The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high (ask for extra rye bread).
($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks).
Really though, where's the seasoning?
The food was just OK, at least for what food was available.
by dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!!
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.
We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.
otherwise, good stuff for late nite eats.
The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.
It is thick and slightly soggy.
Its not the same if you have to sit inside.
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence!
Great people watching as others do the same to you.
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I've experienced the same with other restaurants so I don't appreciate such practice.
He offers subpar service and has no personality.
I'm going back.
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer....
My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years.
wow! how have i missed this one ,tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew.
Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf(ok bad joke), but you will see.
Me and my girls will definitely go back.
The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.
delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven.
Ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in.
All the food was hot tasty.
Have been several times and it never dissapoints.
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza.
Our server was very helpful and friendly.
Try green curry with vegetables.
While I'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business!
This place was not ALL THAT!
First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.
Much more reasonably priced too!
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.
The food was not very tasty, the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant.
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they're eaten.
Why make a reservation if you aren't going to keep it?
The Pad Thai is excellent here, as well.
Big and gawky on the outside.
I have been to Mary's many times and I like it.
Searching to get out from the cold, freezing weather, we went into what we thought was a deli.
I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
This is the best thing in Soho.
Went here last night and had a pleasant experience.
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend.
For $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience.
The food is o.k., but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant.
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great.
I think the stuff was better than Disney.
After reading the good reviews of this restaurant, I decided to give it a try with two friends.
Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC.
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it!
It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.
The staff is no nonsense.
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness.
Wonderful at holiday time.
And really large portions.
The place is a lot of fun.
Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good.
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor.
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.
I recommend the garlic shrimp, okra (bindi), and anything with lamb.
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.
To give you an idea of how good we thought it was, we ended up going to Ping's three weekends in a row!!!
As we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to escargot.
In fact, two people could really share one plate.
The food is great and authentic.
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.
during happy hour!
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers.
Love YUKA.
Go, go, hurry, before everyone finds out about it.
I am bringing my whole family back next time.
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing.
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look.
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.
But the coconut rice was good.
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer.
A guaranteeed delight!
I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years.
Overall I would recommend it and go back again.
The food was great.
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place.
Anyway, this is the last time I cross the williamsburg.
Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal.
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.
When I'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office, I head for Cafe St. Bart's.
Guess the 555Soul ads didn't launch her big modeling career.
Besides, we were on vacation!
I love this cozy around the way Rest.
Don't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo.
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City.
The place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.
But, they were too big for the bun.
Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking.
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
The bagels are fabulous.
Oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the seats are not available.
The food options rule.
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.
We ate here in March, 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight.
Definately check it out!!!
Probably much busier for lunch, it's seldom crowded for dinner (too close to downtown).
Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK.
It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they dont forget to charge you for it.
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.
Saturday, Nov. 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us.
Good spreads, great beverage selections and bagels really tasty.
First, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which I would have chosen had I known about them.
We will be back.
Also, top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu.
It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too.
Check out the secret back room.
It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...
Stick to the gulab jamun.
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem.
Also very inexpensive.
We've only eaten in the restaurant once, but we have ordered many times for dinner.
I got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience.
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!
Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.
My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.
You cannot go wrong with this place.
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late, raucus dinner.
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.
Prices are in line.
The combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY.
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?
For all of you new to Indian food, try the Paneer Roll, it is a piece of heaven.
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal.
I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row.
The food is terrible and overall, I would have to say avoid at all costs.
I've been to this monster sushi twice, the 46th st once, the 23rd st one a number of times.
Unfortunately, the food was NOT something to get worked up about.
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.
The waitstaff were attentive, polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters.
Go inside and you won't want to leave.
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get.
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.
Yes, the prices are high, but I felt it was worth it.
The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.
Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful, despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners.
While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.
The owner truly caters to all your needs.
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent.
Over the years, it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine.
I would go back tho.
The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.
too large for just two people but nothing was left.
I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.
Great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).
A pleasant surprise.
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
If you don't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House.
We got most of it back at home with us.
Get there before 7pm.
very good breads as well.
if this happens, just ask for real naan.
So, if yo really don't care who is sittingnext to you, which is about 2 inches away, I would say try it.
Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta.
Definitely a neighborhood favorite.
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.
My first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend.
Example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the mushrooms where $12 for about 1oz.
Service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal.
There are other people waiting!
From beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations.
OU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT.
We left, never to return.
Consistently good Japanese Tapas.
No apologies during restaurant week.
My goodness, everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing.
This place started off a little iffy, but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC (and I'm indian, so I should know).
They also do a great job for restaurant week.
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.
The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).
This is where the aforementioned line was.
Aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, Will Smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet....
We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied.
i dont how this place is still running.
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile.
We were in search of food and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street.
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
Very excited to hear that short-term Chef Jason Narone has moved on, he truly was a low point of their Sterling track record.
Excellent experience.
Well worth the trip, close to City Hall and downtown subway stops.
What more could you want?
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat.
All in all, I don't see how you can go wrong.
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp.
We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me.
My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.
We were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call.
I'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.
The prices were fantastic.
What a great place!
The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, I understood they were busy.
It's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be.
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).
Although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy.
Even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk.
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner.
Was surprisingly disappointed.
Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat.
I went to Ruby Foo's after work with a group of 6.
I'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet.
Service was prompt, friendly and great.
I haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil.
The sushi was awful!
Katz's has been a NYC original for over 100 years.
You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here.
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.
Late nite omelletes are not good here, there is no variety!
Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned.
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.
It's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner.
Behind this counter, two men are squeezed in.
Great find!!!
If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!
Our waitress was sweet and accomodating, not overbearing.
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.
I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there.
Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.
A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.
In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.
I definitely wouldn't go back.
It is not worth for that bucks.
brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere.
For many people, this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic.
Growing up in NY, I have eaten my share of bagels.
Oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were!
A hearty two thumbs up!
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!
Service is top notch.
The food now is inconsistent.
All pretty good.
You can also special order any kind of dumpling,etc.
you guys rock.
Chance is a joke.
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice.
The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad.
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.
I was at Rao's last Wed.
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two.
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.
Service was quick.
Tends to turn people away.
We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like.
I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine, and have been going back regularly ever since.
Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!
Went there for an office lunch.
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori.
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable.
We've been following chef Lyle's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return.
The best thing I tasted were the lambchops.
it's delicious!
The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we've ever had.
Upon entering, we were greeted by the owners, Steven and Frederick, who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts.
If you live outside the neighborhood, don't bother!
Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably.
Meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices.
I never had anything I didn't like here.
Reasonable prices.
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration.
Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for.
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.
I've been to Joya twice and I will never go again.
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town.
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
if you're looking for perfect traditional sushi, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try sushi of gari's (east side).
No refills on fountain drinks, though.
Wow over 100 beers to choose from.
Be careful of portions - they're HUGE.
The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.
Did I mention the wine?
Plus, on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited!
It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.
Now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.
Love Pizza 33..
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
I'm from England, and Haru's was the best I had in NYC.
Less = More in their case.
Ruby Foo's is a tourist trap.
I've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed.
I've been many time and have never been disappointed.
Ciao Bella
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.
We won't go to this place again for a good meal.
It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.
We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant!
After dinner, take your date to the HUGE dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in NY.
Has the chef and owner changed???
My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience.
I absolutely Loved this place.
I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possible!
But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!
If you're in town, it's worth searching for another place.
I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one.
I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.
They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food!
kalbi and nebbiolo do work together.
Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot).
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food.
Located at the end of a magnificent block.
Keep up the good work guys!
Hurley's is terrific!
They don't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum.
Took my sister here before attending a show one evening.
Great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady).
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.
Really.
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.
Our friends have not arrived yet.
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.
Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed.
The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.
But the main hit was the whole grilled fish.
I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don't have to deal with crowds or lines.
Pizza here is consistently good.
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!
Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.
My husband and I enjoy Sangria.
But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.
Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter.
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.
Other apetizers and food
The noodle and rices dishes taste great.
The food's as good as ever.
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.
The sauces used are also not that exciting.
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.
I absolutely love this place!!!
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.
There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those.
If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!
No thanks!!!
There was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice.
I would definently recommend this restaurant.
The prices are wonderfully low.
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.
I lOVE THIS PLACE!
So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers.
A big disappointment, all around.
And its absolutely DELICIOUS.
No free drink.
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.
Definitely Highly NOT recommended.
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.
Don't waste money on decor.
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?
go to any corned indian restaurant, and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme!
Given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character.
I'd call it an 'italian dinner'.
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary.
I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night.
Their eggplant is so delicate, sweet tender!
I pray it stays open forever.
Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant.
If you want to save some money, don't go here.
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.
I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).
This is the first time Citysearch did't call it right.
You should pass on the calamari.
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps.
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE.
The fries are yummy.
Friendly and informative staff, very attentive and prompt raw bar service.
Best Taiwanese food in NY!
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.
This place is a great stop for great food.
All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City.
What for?
Fantastic!
they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date.
We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip, which was generous, I feel.
And the prices were way to high for what you get.
But people from Sichuan will die for it)  - Chongqing Hot Pot, chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan, now became an independent province.
Skip Baroanda down the street (Eurotrashy, snooty and expensive) and check this place out!
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.
The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there.
Yet paired with such rude service, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there.
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.
I need at least three rolls to be full, and that's at least $14.00!
Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment.
The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale.
Beef noodle soup is good as well.
I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got!
Delivery service is great too.
The food's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine.
I recieved prompt service with a smile.
They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT's.
The place was quiet and delightful.
Molto bene!
.the best I've found outside of the Chinatown masters.
They are amazing!
Avoid this place!
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.
A must try!
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
The soup is pretty good too.
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week's notice.
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats.
If you go to Roth's try to be served by Mike, he is GREAT!!
Based on a visit a month ago, I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed.
Went here on a friend's reccomendation.
not the food ,not the ambiance , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .
I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh.
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night.
We will definitely go back.
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am.
Is just the way it was in days gone by.
The food is amazing!!!!
Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues.
The atmosphere is great!!!
It can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it.
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.
The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful.
The pickles were great addition.
If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place.
You must try the shrimp appetizers.
Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.
It's like you are transported to the Italian countryside, very romantic and filled with antiques.
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.
Just go and see for yourself.
The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated.
I hate this.
Any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar.
Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.
That place was awesome,,,  sally !
The food at this place is 'gourmet' Indian cuisine.
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!
get over it!
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'pub'.
However, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.
While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich, Katz's has a charm about it.
However, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza, which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT.
Priced at upper intermediate range.
The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.
I recommend ordering in on a weeknight.
Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel.
So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave.
It's very spicy but not offensive.
they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table.
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
They used shredded cheese on top!
They are located in the middle of Chinatown!
Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito's home.
Katz's deli is a great NY experience.
Check it out.
The only positive was the wait staff, which was prompt, knowledgable, and likeable.
I couldn't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher.
I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.
For the location, the prices are very reasonable.
My friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime.
I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I don't have to rush off to a show.
Hopefully next time, I will save room for dessert.
Alain Ducasse is the best of everything, I mean everything was excelent.I
The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth.
GO HERE.
The best Chicken pad tai, I've ever had.
We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.
$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten.
It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .
Over 100 different choices to create your own.
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.
We got a little tipsy from the sake but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?
I almost wanted to write a bad review, so no one would ever go here and I could have all the dumplings to myself!
After reading the posts, I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow, despite living in Park Slope.
I loved it and will be back soon.
Always a nice crowd, but never loud.
My turkey burger was not cooked at all, my friends salmon was completely raw.
The service is spotty, sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there.
Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend.
His drinks are very inventive, delicious and classy.
This isn't your corner Chinese food takeout.
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.
My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com,
Try ordering from the regular menu, then you would not regret!
Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.
uni from maine vs california, sea vs freshwater eel) to get a good taste comparison.
We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner.
The crispy chicken wasn't for us, though.
JUST AWSOME.
Food is great.
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me.
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!
This place is incredibly tiny.
I will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!
I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.
This is one of our all-time favorite.
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.
The wine is always good, the tapas are always yummy, especially with the warm pita bread.
this place is amazingly bad.
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down.
I love this place.
Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time.
The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.
The problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair.
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better.
The fried rice is really good too.
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.
Made my dining experience uncomfortable.
It's a steal!
We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments.
still stay away, the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer...
I was with a party of 7 (close but not next the the front doors) and we were eating with our coats on.
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.
What's the difference between the two?
Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!
Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz' Deli, or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants.
I was very disappointed with this restaurant.
We also had shared a house salad that was fresh.
The ceiling is amazing!
My wife and I were in NYC celebrating our 30th anniversary.
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY.
Not a small feat for good french food in the area.
The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.
Food was average but tasty.
We come from New Jersey to eat at Kinoko.
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.
Will never be back.
The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.
I highly recommend it.
Oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.
The Pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places.
my picks: Guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu).
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.
My six year old loved it.
Pizza was a little soggy.
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever.
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.
Murray won't do it.
I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location.
Definite go if you're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad.
THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT, MODERN, YET COZY.
By far, the best pizza in Manhattan.
Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs, so be aware.
The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away.
The food is mostly made from scratch, fresh and well prepared.
Worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill.
Too cold to enjoy.
NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.
Try the sea bass.
I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it.
Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.
During our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.
But they don't have a toaster, which is strange.
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.
A must for all the Dosa lovers.
The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar.
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table.
If you are a vegetarian, this really isn't a good place to go.
Try the mediterranean salad, it is a true experience for your taste buds!!
I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.
Of course, it is crowded but who cares.
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list.
I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.
People are always friendly.
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!!
From the entrees to the sides to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple.
hmmm.
Service was prompt and courteous.
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap (undercooked) beef.
Chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great.
It was nice and fresh, but I can't give it high scores on being authentic thai.
Overall, worht every penny.
When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.
Got club soda, filled with ice, no lime.
Only wine and beer are served, but the house varities are actually quite good.
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build.
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant.
I haven't been to the other locations.
Oh, and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy!
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap.
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks.
Decent wine selection too.
Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time.
It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime.
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here.
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.
The place does get crowded, so I recommend going between 4-5 PM.
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).
I'm from sichuan, this is the restaurant I recommend going.
This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street.
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer.
But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they're doing.
But I'd go back
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.
Good, dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch.
My husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me.
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished.
This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai (another delicious Thai restaurant).
Great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap.
Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.
Perhaps the last reviewer (who stated she was treated with attitude) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda.
That said, I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had.
Everything about this restaurant was special.
Because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing.
I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited.
It is expensive but well worth the money.
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.
i would recommend reservations on weekends though.
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is #1.
Great pizza for lunch place.
I don't think I would go again.
And that's no mean feat...
I often go there to eat with my family.
I wish they would change back to what it was before.
NO PIZZA 33 for me!
I LOVE their spicy scallop roll, and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken.
I'm no food critic, but I'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years.
I noted it was crossed off on the bill.
Needless to say, I'm never going back and you should be wary too.
Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna.
The food was absolutely amazing!!
Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food.
I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time.
I went here with my boyfriend and another couple.
The staff is also attentive and friendly.
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.
This is definitely a place that provides the best experience, though, to both A-listers and people walking in off the street.
first it took us a long time to find the place.
The food was good too.
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best.
Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US.
I am a die hard peep lover.
Once you become a regular, you are treated as one.
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.
Everyone treats you like you were part of the family.
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats.
The menu is nothing like the one on the website.
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.
SEA has become so popular that they've let it go to their heads.
We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly.
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.
The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.
Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe.
(Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city).
My roommate and I LOVE this place.
The waitstaff are all very busy, it's not outstanding service, but I've never been dealt with rudely.
Not worth it.
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.
So close, but not good enough.
This was on a Tuesday night.
Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (I happen to live in Inwood).
The flavors are great, and the menu is extensive.
This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg, and will impress whoever you bring there.
The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down.
I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy.
And forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either.
Don't waste your time, or money!!
They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.
We couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.
We just ate at Kai and were disapointed.
This was a great surprise.
The food was spicy and delicious.
I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening.
It was wonderful.
Went for a late weekday lunch.
I just don't understand all the hype...
Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar.
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet.
Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter.
You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation.
I don't get it either.
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.
Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.
It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).
One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.
One of my favorite places in Manhattan.
They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.
We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived.
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.
I for one will never patronize them again.
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood.
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try.
The service, however, was a bright flower in a garden.
So, again, give it a try.
Stay far away from this place.
We will come back!!!
We've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.
The food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special.
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.
Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes.
We'd go back again
We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.
The location is perfect.
Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared.
The lunch special is an asbolute steal.
This food is asian-air fusion.
i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning.
But on a lazy Saturday night, we ended up going.
There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience.
I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.
Once for dinner and once for brunch.
I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.
Not worth the prices.
Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central.
From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic.
I only have friends.
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice.
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods, indian included, i made friends with this place long ago.
Please save yourself the frustration.
And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner.
(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!
If your visiting, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in Time Sq...
We were on our way back to NJ, and since I am in NY, we figured why not grab some food?
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective!
And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair.
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris.
Every course was better than the next.
Not cheap, but not that expensive either.
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.
If presentation and service is your thing, then this magic show works.
Apparently, the good cook works then.
I was pleasantly suprised.
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.
One less manhattanite the better.
Everyone is welcomed in as family.
I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil.
The menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.
Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.
Look elsewhere.
More important, the sushi rivals the best in Tokyo.
I have never had cheescake like this.
Bill a little high, but worth it.
I seriously doubt I will ever dine at Jimmy's Bronx, or for that matter, Jimmy's Uptown, again.
Everyone I bring here always loves it.
My co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery, only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered.
Worth a visit.
A real dissapointment.
Its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests.
Why do people rave about the ambience.
Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished.
Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.
Great sushi experience.
They charge $6.00 for rice.
My steak au poivre was one of the worst I've had.
On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT.
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!
Would definitely visit again.
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City!
Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food, this is simply dull.
The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened.
You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice.
so i thought why not change it up a bit.
My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great!
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different.
P.S. Please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there.
my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.
To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food.
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8!
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish.
I went to pams with my girlfriend, and i love it.
But for whatever reason, prices are about twice as high.
Great atmoshere and worth every bit.
We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant.
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!
The staff was knowledgeable and full of personality.
Great staff.
To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert, especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate.
The banana tower is an amazing dessert as well.
I went there with my friend last saturday.
Great vibe, lots of people.
I like Mamoun's food as well, but side by side, Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down.
Just an odd group.
The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.
Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.
I love this place!
it is not consistent.
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
Wine list is not huge but def well selected.
Be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, specials.
Fresh, authentic, french cuisine in substantial portions.
Drinks got screwed up, she acted put upon.
The one vegetarian entree (Abby's treasure) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables.
At 5 dumplings for $1, you just cannot go wrong.
But the pizza is way to expensive.
And the staff is also young, energeic and hot!!!!
Even better, they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it.
Service was decent, but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation.
We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC.
Good drink.
Was there Friday night.
We had a girls' night dinner here for restaurant week.
Romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit).
However, I was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling.
I recommend it!
I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well.
enough said!
I don't live in NY but my best friend does.
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily.
we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan.
I didn't take a look at the rest menu, but the oysters were fantastic.
After the review I treked into Brooklyn.
The grilled cheese at home afterwards was better.!!
We were pleasantly greeted.
The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside.
In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
Recommendations, of course, are required!
We did have to wait at the bar for approx.
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town.
Yeah, it's that good.
If you love seafood, you would love this place!
Good, fast service.
They charge different prices all the time.
To dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside, its so bland on the inside.
I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.
I have been going back again and again.
It's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.
In terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.
Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat.
Overall, excellent restaurant!
To begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.
The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly I might add).
The service was ok.
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it!
Don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full.
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.
But too far east!
Satisfying.
Highly Highly Highly recommended!
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food.
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation.
This place is cool enough to be in the East Village, but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris.
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry.
The staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces.
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area.
No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.
Largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious!
Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.
After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.
This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv.
now if they could only get a toaster.
You will find yourself returning quite often.
The ingredients taste fresher, the crust is thinner and crispier, the slice is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe's.
Fish is so very fresh.
Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.
less wait time for me!
The decor is really blah, and not at all hip or happening.
You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.
It appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.
I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.
I go twice a month!
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.
The food was authentic.
I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I've tried similar dishes at.
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.
A million better places to go in the city.
If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.
Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry.
I love it.
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.
We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.
Its located in greenewich village.
There is no excuse for such lousy service!
Three strikes and this restaurant is out.
We bring in a party of ten or so every week.
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque.
So, a little inconsistency there but either way, both pizzas were really good.
We would return to this place again!
Not enough wines by the glass either.
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.
I must say it's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view.
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.
Just don't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there.
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.
Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater.
One should not go to Lucky Strike for the food.
The service is awful--the last time I was there (and I do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave.
To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.
Try everything for that matter, it is all good.
Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table (even though we had reservations).
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone.
night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience.
Try the green curry!!!
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.
The food there are sastifying.
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.
I agree.
The food was good.
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.
at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous.
It just wasn't Thai.
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection.
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix.
We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire.
Recommended.
The place was nice and calm.
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out.
When we sat, we got great and fast service.
Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.
I think locals rate this place so high.
Service is average.
But they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual).
Go girls!!!
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.
The steak is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great.
For asian fusion, there are many places further downtown.
Old school meets New world.
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.
This is probably one of my new favorite places.
For being number 1, this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation.
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side.
They all know you.
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin.
The buffet had a nice selection.
Waitstaff are very friendly.
This restaurant is such a great place.
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.
I've been several times and am totally smitten.
Terrible experience.
I love the place.
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.
Will have to return to try the chocolate!
It's only $1.95 for a regular slice and $4.00 for a slice with a mushroom, not mushrooms.
There is a real gallery of stars that have visited.
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS.
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel.
service was efficient courteous.
this one is definintely my least favorite.
I have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn.
The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past.
Everytime my husband and I go there, we are never disappointed.
They are the best bagels I've had.
We were not disappointed.
I've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food.
Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.
We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but, that's just it -- the PAST!
However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.
Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
We had the most wonderful waitress.
While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly, I have never experienced more incompetency.
The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor.
Okay, so I never write but there doesn't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it's time to speak up - I live in Chinatown.
The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth.
The staff is courteous and friendly.
Never fails to please.
Will absolutely visit again.
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. .
And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!
This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $19.95!
I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC.
Went to Village last night for my birthday.
Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order.
The specials are usually quite good too.
They've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods.
Try the chocolate mud cake (warmed) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato.
That's good and bad.
Really cool stauff inside.
The best burger I have had in the Village.
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 menu.
I would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space.
Would NEVER go back there.
Three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations.
There is usually a wait but it is well worth it.
Be careful, when they say spicy, they mean it!
Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere (Anywhere).
Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.
Bring your appetites.
The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).
Of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?
Service was very good and warm.
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC.
Seriously, this place kicks ass.
Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.
The food is nothing like its menu description.
Try the Pad Se-Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience.
It's just O.K. pizza.
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
I've been here twice now.
THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
The service was a bit slow, but they were very friendly.
However, I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant.
It's a small cute restaurant.
I will be returning.
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city.
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu.
The food was absolutely horrible!
Food doesn't appear to be cooked on premisis but there's a high turnover so its pretty fresh.
Restaurant was dirty and unkempt.
Nice place though.
Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!
Similar to other Indian restaurants, they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door.
It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed!
The crackling calamari salad, which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants, is crispy and lightly dressed.
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20.
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy!
We've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we've been lucky?
Drinks way over priced.
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.
What I didn't like was how the food came right after it was ordered.
But WARNING: to all those that use this site be weary, be very weary of recommendations.
Moderate prices.
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.
Try it side by side and there's no comparison.
I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow.
My biggest complaint was the un-tasty food although presented well.
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.
So sorry I can't rate this better.
Most importantly, food is excellent.
Buon appetito!
Great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet.
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant.
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing.
Ok, for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late.
I would highly recommend it.
It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE.
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise.
Finally, after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be.
Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic...
The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.
Went last Thursday.
I love this place more and more everytime i go.
We only ordered desserts and drinks, but no refills were offered.
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.
Waiters are slow but sweet.
I have been here a few times for dinner, once for brunch and twice for lunch.
We went to Ino for Valentines.
the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass.
It was good, but was not what I thought it would be.
The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited.
The bread and lamb chops I had before the meal were quite good, however.
He always says, I don't have customers.
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian.
Good for dates or with friends.
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala.
The kitchen however, is almost always slow.
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent, much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square.
We had a good time.
Also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do...
people are rude bit again it's new york!
We all felt it was worth it.
The plain slice is great and if you get toppings, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places.
Based on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM.
You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.
Came looking for this place because I heard good things.
I live on the street this place is on.
Horrible.
Here's to the fake fish tanks too...
Its worth the wait though.
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute.
Unique apppetizers.
The staff has always been attentive and kind, and I've always been amazed at how they've handled all the various different group sizes that come in.
IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant.
Nothing special about this place.
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
and never strayed.
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
Leave the kids at home!
And all of that won't break your bank!
The Thai food is good.
Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants.
Great selection of wine, and seafood.
delicious.
Acceptable prices.
Big thumbs up!
we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda.
We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant.
They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.
Definitely not worth the price!
It's easy to get a table for a large group and you don't get hustled out.
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal.
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef, and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways.
That's why you have to pay more for that.
I loved it.
They're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing, Queens.
The prices are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch.
and you can't beat the prices.
but I wouldn't wanna live there.
Arigato Gozimas Yuka!
Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it.
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce, which was wonderful.
Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn.
This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip.
I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli.
I would highly recommend this place!
Yes, there might be a wait if you have no reservations.
Thank You Emilio.
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks.
- i asked for them spicy and they were delicious).
The sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great!
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.
The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.
Off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants.
Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal.
This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.
One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.
Everyone was more then happy with his choices.
Again, the waitress was awesome.
Worth the trip from Manhattan.
Zero ambiance to boot.
Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining.
i recommend the thai popcorn :)
I can't wait for the nex time.
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.
The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.
Great neighborhood joint.
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent.
The only disappointment was the coat check girls who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night (for the coat check girls).
Ummm...the beer was cold.
I take all my NYC guests to VT's.
It is sometimes a little cramped, and can get a little warm, but hello, it's NYC!
Good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese vibe.
Even with the prix fixe pricing, this restaurant is not worth it.
We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.
Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case.
Good bagels and good cream cheese.
It is also extremely well priced.
Always great service!
I am happy i did the food was awsome.
I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites.
We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.
I went to DF for Valentines Day dinner.
I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.
and i have been around the block, to say the very least.
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge.
As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats ,except at Taj Mahal.
Give it a try and enjoy.
Good food.
...and that's saying a lot.
those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.
The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.
if your into thai..you cannot miss this great restaurant.
Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city.
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location!
Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends.
I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed.
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity.
I think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic.
I have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups.
When you want a piece of beef, head on over.
Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.
I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this, but the second visit was even worse.
Unbelievable.
I've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens.
The menu has lots of options: I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes.
As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling.
This restaurant was way overhyped.
Delicious crab cakes too.
Now at the top of our list, Del Frisco's Steakhouse.
I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
This was the worst dining experience I've ever had.
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.
Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you.
I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again, I will certainly stop by.
The bruschetta and panini's are so yummy!
Food was okay, nothing great.
Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair.
I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.
Always popular, always full, always a wait.
In fact, you can't miss it.
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.
A little noise but I think that was because of our party!
It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown.
Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.
I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.
If you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share, Kai may not be the best option.
go here for the drinks!
I don't get it, what's so special about Prune ?
I'd definitely recommend this little place.
Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.
The first 2 courses were very good, but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet.
Butter was melted, white wine warm, cheese oozing everywhere.
We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.
Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe's to eat here.
It cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.
I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more!
We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course (other restaurants offer 3 choices) and ended up ordering a la carte.
Authentic Pakistani food.
The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating, and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions.
Get it together.
Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive.
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.
We began with the cheese fondue (the artisanal blend) and added apples and kielbasa to dip.
In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch, this place is great.
Its not curry in a slurry crap, and regular run of the mill food.
Even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems.
The bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful.
An excellent service
The food however, is what one might expect.
I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!
The pizza was really good.
The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in Chinese.
Food is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better.
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
Enjoy!!!
Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them.
Kudos to Po!
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.
My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended.
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back.
Their sushi, Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented.
For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.
It's true, you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas.
I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday.
I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list.
Never again!
The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down, rushing you out.
Have the iced tea.
For Park avenue I expected so much more.
Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.
So rude.
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce!
The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date.
They are FAST.
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.
Very neighborhoody, very quick and sufficient.
Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys.
And I could do without the cigar smoke.
Still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences.
I've waited over one hour for food.
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.
The ambience is very calm and quiet.
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.
Great deal!
Stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint).
not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere.
Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine.
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food (all fast foods in my opinion).
Besides, when you have bad service, that's less money you have to tip.
We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore.
The wine list is also really nice.
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.
I plan on stopping by next week as well.
Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!
Ballato's is consistently delicious authentic italian food.
The service was attentive, yet discreet.
As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city.
Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.
Highly recommended to all!
highly recommended.
Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place, and are not in a rush, this place is a bad idea.
You have to increase the service a lot.
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.
After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!
After the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES!
It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC.
Nothing better than buying a snapple for $3.25 too.
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.
The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
After a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info.
Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.
Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating.
always fresh and delicious.
The food was very good, but not very thai.
The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.
This is a fun restaurant to go to.
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night.
Their sake martini is wonderful.
Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.
Bravissimo !!
Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch!
We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience!!!
When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back, in a veyr good sense.
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
This is the Cheers of New York, whether you've ever been there or not.
It's to die for!
Cute and decorative.
I know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable.
fine dining restaurant quality.
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.
The food was exceptional.
You will be satisfied.
Another great place to take out-of-towners!
But, hey, there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria.
We were less than impressed.
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?
but still my date was bad
Would definitely go back again.
I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve.
Sure, the setting is nice.
Overall a worthwhile experience.
It's really a takeaway place, I wouldn't sit if I could take it home.
THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!
Some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy's.
Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.
I had a great experience.
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal.
The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit.
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar.
Having been a long time Ess-a-Bagel fan, I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray's.
Go for it!
Highly recommended.
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.
To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.
The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great.
We always get a sampling of appetizers and share.
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic.
The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy.
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
But $1 for each small piece???
Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.
big and soft as well as good lunch food.
I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant.
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
Not a great place for family or general dining.
As for the bar, this is another bad idea.
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for.
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.
The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
What generous portions!
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
I was wrong.
The highly spiced chai tea was great too.
No plans to return anytime soon.
I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.
Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.
There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.
I just do not understand what the fuss is all about.
The meat dishes were only so-so.
We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.
And you're hungry a few hours later.
I can't wait to go back.
I HATE HATE HATE this place.
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.
Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.
Wonderful!
It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.
The service is descent even when this small place is packed.
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.
Go hungry and enjoy.
I have eaten a lot of pizza here.
This place is worth an one-hour drive.
The sushi is also great!
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.
The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.
The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.
The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.
All I can say is WOW!
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.
The lox is always fresh too.
Sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.
Service was very friendly.
Food was OK - fish was cooked well.
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
The staff offers impeccable service.
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
wont come back again for sure!
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.
The place is sleek, modern and playfull and i will return again frequently.
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
And the bill was outragous.
Kind, attentive wait staff.
Bon appettite!!
Salads were fantastic.
La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.
The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
A great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots.
skip dessert.
It is simply amazing.
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.
It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool.
I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return.
A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $2.50.
It's all about the food !!
Fast service.
Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
The staff is excellent, specjal: that girl behind the bar, european chic.
stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes.
The service was bad, the food took to forever to come, we sat on the upper level.
We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident.
ALWAYS full with tourists (especially because of it's close proximity to Rockefeller Center).
The decor is nice, but more casual than fine dining.
Bravo, Blue Hill!
Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.
My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village.
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.
This place is to be avoided.
My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing.
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
At 6:30, we were the third party there.
I will definetly be going back.
No, really.
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.
I've been to Naples 45 for dinner twice.
The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else.
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place (he painted the ballato's sign in the window).
Try sushimi cucumber roll.
I'm saving up for my next visit.
The food is delicious.
Amma is nothing special.
believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.
Worth it for a special occasion, or any time!
The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).
I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.
The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size.
I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike, a great name for a joint if ever I saw one.
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.
Definitely a once a year treat that I look forward to around the holidays!
Service is fast and friendly.
from an English speaking staff.
Anyhow, we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat, which was nice.
And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world!
A defitely must visit.
My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full.
We all ate pasta entre'es, which were great.
My friends and I showed up on a Sat.
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat).
great experience overall.
PERFECT FOR DATES!
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.
Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes.
The service is ok but could be better.
(I've ordered from the 2nd ave.
Nothing against a good sales call, but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious.
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar (chef Yoshi) and ordered everything ala carte.
If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.
However, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par.
A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30.
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.
I recommend their Pad See Ew, Pork Chops or Tofu plates.
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.
The main course had an average portion, and was decent overall.
Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.
Waitstaff is great, very attentive.
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular.
The dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well.
IT IS WHAT MODERN CUISINE IS ALL ABOUT.
I definitely will go back.
I don't like Indian food too much and this was delicious, however you want to factor that into the equation.
at taj, vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven.
Finally!
Forget the rush and the wait and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic?
Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.
I've never been disappointed.
I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.
We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if I call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so I wouldn't have to look for parking).
From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.
Jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx.
And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles' heel.
My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed.
The $300 bill was a bit steep, but the experience was great.
I wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.
I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons.
The calamari comes with an incredible sauce, and the duck noodles are yummy as well.
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard.
For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions.
But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out.
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.
I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.
We didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.
Beautiful experience.
The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC.
If you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a table for 2.
Decor leaves something to be desired.
Jimmy is Dominican!
Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse.
I've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I'm craving for Pho, Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice, this is the place to go.
Oh yes, and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, I would love to know where they obtained.
The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the main course, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you'll need no more.
The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead.
My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce.
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.
Even upon delivery, their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
This is also where I was from.
Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.
Joe's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up.
I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris.
I have never had anything like it!
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited.
The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.
Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.
I am Indian, and I have tried many Indian places in NY.
On a recent Saturday night, I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar.
The price very reasonable.
Dessert - can't be missed, so save room!!!
It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order, but once the food is ordered, you are in for a treat.
Take a good sense of humor,an American express card with no limit, walk out with a lollipop,gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me.
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine, even with no idea how to use them.
THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST.
As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst.
The service was superb, they treat you like family.
It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table, but standing up wasn't too bad.
The menu may be small, but everything on it is delicious.
Too bad Latin Quarters closed.
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL.
It was divine melts in your mouth.
Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently.
I live a block away and go to Patsy's frequently.
When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside, she recommended that we go to this restaurant.
Warm, comfortable surroundings, nice appointments (witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms).
Kudos Haru
I plan on eating here more often.
I would definitely go back for a very special occasion, but not for regular fine dining.
The well mannered, pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ.
The flavors robust and subtle.
I came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.
I would never wait for a table to eat, it just is not THAT great.
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.
The counter service is bad.
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!
its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.
This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.
and we were thouroughly disapointed.
This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES.
The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect.
Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x.
They have some great entrees here as well.
Our teenage kids love it, too.
The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent.
The food, served in small tasting portions (as an option) is very good with each dish being better than the next.
You guys are awesome!
I loved this place!!
I had the mango chicken and i can't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful.
Avoid at all costs.
I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion!
The service is fantastic.
I recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon
The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city!
great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...
The lamb meat was under-cooked and EXTRMELY CHEWY.
The best pad thai i've ever had.
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
i would just ask for no oil next time.
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.
I really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central.
None of that yucky whipped stuff.
The wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.
I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it.
Their coffee is quite good too!
I would not recommend this place to anyone.
Despite the fact that the space is large, they've overcrowded the floor with tables.
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.
As far as the service goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done.
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.
Normally that would be improper, however they were all delicious and my host did not complain.
Taxan delicious!
Perhaps it was an off night, but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating.
Southern Indian cuisine is still there, too.
Restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place.
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.
They couldn't even make a salad that was appealing.
For two people with tip was less than $25 bucks.
Killer Sushi!
Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious!
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.
And I've been to many NYC delis.
This place is always packed.
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.
Plus they made a perfect martini.
I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch.
I've eaten thai many times, and am very familiar with the cuisine.
The waiter was attentive.
Their Margarita is best I've had since I've returned from Naples!
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.
The tastes makes your mouth water for more.
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband.
All in all a wonderful experience, can't wait to come back.
The food was actually aweful.
after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now, its official !
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.
This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine.
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach, the Shanghai low mein, and other attractions.
Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit.
Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down.
I would go back.
Definitely will be back!
Several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces.
I'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much.
they live up to the thai way of living.
If you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here!
Three page wine menu, one page entree and horedevous.
The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected.
I live nearby and when they first opened, I ate there a lot.
And the food was fantastic.
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
They're also friendlier here, especially the owner, Kenny.
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered.
The bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher! 2 for 1's.
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!
I like the ambience, it's very dark and original.
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.
We were exploring Grand Central and didn't want to eat in the food court.
Overall, not worth the money.
This place is not worth the prices.
We left after one drink.
Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre.
Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy.
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city.
You are paying for the atmosphere, which is nice, but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge.
It's called Gnochi alla nona and is found under Chef Specials.
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.
The fried dumplings are GREAT!
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city.
Ive been here so many times the waiters know my name.
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
I've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I've never been disappointed.
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large Pelligrino, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.
Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day.
The 'kamasutra' and 'bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time.
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples.
The dim sum here is only so-so.
It was raining, and we figured why not?
Another welcome addition to the neighborhood.
Seating is ok even though sometimes there's alot of people.
This time, I prefer not to go into detail.
Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine, if you can call $70.00 inexpensive, the cost is through the roof for better than average fare.
Service was slow, but the people were friendly.
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty.
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!
And affordable.
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret.
The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not (like the steak dish which tends to be dry).
Not only would I not recommend Jimmy's restaurants to friends, I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but.
They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody.
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.
As a long-time patron of Mamoun's, I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city.
I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores.
The bagel was huge.
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.
Get the tuna of gari.
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.
It was a very nice surprise.
I am French and I really felt like home!!!
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.
It's usually packed for good reason, esp.
Service- friendly and attentive.
I love going there!
I cannot recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself.
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York.
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
And, atlhough tables opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space, they left us awkardly seated.
The palak paneer was standard, and I was not a fan of the malai kofta.
I've dined at Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience.
Yeah, sometimes the service can be slow.
There was no ambiance.
Save your money and don't waste your calories, go to Margharita's on Washington Street instead, they have amazing food and the BEST service.
But trust me it is so worth it.
It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge.
THe perfect spot.
The only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.
They sell special sushi, everything have a topping, sauce and etc.
They never came back to refill our glasses again.
Service was also very good.
I took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing, really good meal.
I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it, but they were not!
They're rude at times, and not very friendly.
Good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays.
They kindly brought us more to see if it was better, but it was not!
love the food.
All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews.
There's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style.
It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.
Best Reuben sandwich ever!
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well!
Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for dinner, assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook.
I loved it and would go again.
Frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side.
SO SO SO SO SO good!
Alone for 100 bucks, it is really overprice.
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best.
Very good value
Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid.
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time.
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people.
Overall, the best bagel in town.
Everything a NY pizza joint should be.
It was huge, delicious, fresh, and will be the reason we return.
We go often.
Light, refreshing summer rolls (not fried) remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris.
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.
moral stay away.
but the service was a bit slow.
When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli, I knew there was going to be good pizza!
No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates.
Indoor was very cozy and cute.
We had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time.
They're terrific!!
Great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner.
Just stick with the small dishes!
I've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I've been going.
Food is excellent.
This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers, right off of Pell St (barber's alley) in Chinatown.
They outshine HH.
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great.
We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past.
If you're not familiar with the cuisine, you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they don't accept credit cards.
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
Just wish they'd expand.
My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly!
This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.
You can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown.
I have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good.
keep up the good work.
I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place.
Make sure you try this place as often as you can.
Grilled whole fish wonderful, great spicing.
For years, I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best, but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit.
Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!
The service was great as well.
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx.
I will go back to Suan soon!
Loved it!
We were pleasantly surprised.
It is LOUD, HOT and DARK.
It was wonderful.
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.
Will give it another chance before I write it off.
The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start.
Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts.
If you go here - your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas.
It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone.
The filet mignon dish was superb!
Can't wait wait for my next visit.
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
The food is good, I can't lie.
great food, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!
I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.
The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.
This place is worth going even if only for their beer.
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.
The sandwhiches are out-of-this world!
If you live in Upper Manhattan, Siam Square is THE place for Thia food.
Decor is charming.
The food was very well prepared.
Stay away from this place.
Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.
Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.
If you go for the pre-theatre menu, it's an even greater deal.
The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you, brother?
Brava La Pizza Fresca!
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity, elegance, and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size, Kai is your place.
If just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.
Little Tonino's is just awesome, our favorite delivery place in Kennsington, honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had!
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal.
I go back in line like three times on average until I can't walk anymore.
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue or table grilling.
Bleecker St Pizza is the best!
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY.
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites.
Faan is sooo good.
We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I'm not sure which dim sum dish it was.
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls.
I will not be coming here at 3am again.
Unbelievable.
Very good wine choices.
